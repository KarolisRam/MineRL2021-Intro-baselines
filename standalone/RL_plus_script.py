"""
Reinforcement Learning agent that trains on MineRLTreechop environment. It is then evaluated on MineRLObtainDiamond by
running it for a certain number of ticks and then switching to the scripted part that crafts a wooden_pickaxe and digs
down to get some cobblestone.
With default parameters it trains in about 8 hours on a machine with a GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU.
It uses less than 8GB RAM and achieves an average reward of 8.3.

    The default MineRL action space is the following dict:

    It can be viewed as:
         - buttons, like attack, back, forward, sprint that are either pressed or not.
         - mouse, i.e. the continuous camera action in degrees. The two values are pitch (up/down), where up is
           negative, down is positive, and yaw (left/right), where left is negative, right is positive.
         - craft/equip/place actions for items specified above.
    So an example action could be sprint + forward + jump + attack + turn camera, all in one action.

    This wrapper makes the action space much smaller by selecting a few common actions and making the camera actions
    discrete. You can change these actions by changing self._actions below. That should just work with the RL agent,
    but would require some further tinkering below with the BC one.
